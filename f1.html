<h1>F1 poetry</h1>

<p>
(Grand Prix Blues)

The road hums low like a drop-D riff,
black vinyl stretching under a burning sun,
tires howl—pure blues,
a bent note screaming at 300 clicks an hour.

McLaren comes first—
papaya lightning,
sleek as a Les Paul through a Marshall stack.
They don’t just race, they groove,
precision with swagger,
engine singing like it knows the chorus already.

Ferrari—ah, Ferrari—
that’s old soul blues, red and aching,
a heartbreak solo from Modena,
sometimes perfect, sometimes bleeding,
but always played with feeling.

Mercedes rolls in like prog metal—
tight, technical, disciplined thunder,
every bar measured, every beat exact,
machines that think in odd time signatures.

Red Bull?
Pure adrenaline punk—
high energy, fearless dives,
a can cracked open mid-corner,
chaos flirting with genius.

Aston Martin slides by,
British rock heritage,
Green like a vinyl sleeve from the ’70s,
smooth, confident, understated cool.

Alpine, Williams, Haas—
garage bands with heart,
scraping for volume,
chasing that one perfect lap
that turns noise into legend.

And the track—oh the track—
Monaco whispers jazz,
Spa roars like doom metal in the rain,
Monza is a crowd chant,
Mexico a festival drumline pounding the chest.

Flags wave like lighters in the dark,
engines fade, silence drops—
ears still ringing, soul still racing.

Because Formula 1 isn’t just speed,
it’s rhythm, risk, rebellion—
a never-ending jam session
where the road listens
and the brave
play it loud.

Melbourne dawn,
engines tune like blues licks in the smoke,
